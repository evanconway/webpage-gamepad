Need to figure out how to check gamepad state. The logic isn't too tricky, but we setup a request animation frame loop. If we're going to reference a component state within that loop, we'll have to resetup the requestAnimationFrame loop each time. I'm not quite sure how to do this atm. Will look at more later.

I'm not sure how axis are logged with this api. Let's add raw axis and button values to the tracked state, rig up a system that detects the last changed controller, plugin a controller and see what happens.

So it looks like the id value for gamepads is actually like a product name. I assumed it was an UUID of some kind. It also looks like the different types of gamepads register dramatically different data for the axis and d-pad. For example, an xbox 360 controller registers full 0-1 inputs on 4 separate buttons for the d-pad, but the nintendo switch or pokken controller registers 9 distinctely different values on the same button for the d-pad. 

Since we seem to get the name of the controller type from the api, we could probably hard code different logic for interpretting controls based on the gamepad id. Unfortuantely I don't have a good way to test this outside of literally acquiring a bunch of different controllers. For now, let's just hard code based on the id, and worry about expanding later.
