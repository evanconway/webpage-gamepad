Need to figure out how to check gamepad state. The logic isn't too tricky, but we setup a request animation frame loop. If we're going to reference a component state within that loop, we'll have to resetup the requestAnimationFrame loop each time. I'm not quite sure how to do this atm. Will look at more later.

I'm not sure how axis are logged with this api. Let's add raw axis and button values to the tracked state, rig up a system that detects the last changed controller, plugin a controller and see what happens.
